#############################
# saved_model/Ezzat         #
It is directory that I save the trained weights after each run for sake of transfer learning and re-use the trained model without retraining it 

#############################
# LSTM_Classifier.py        #
It is the python function, where the LSTM architecture is designed with the given inputs
